# 🧠 WISDOM.md - Jarvis Experience & Patterns

## Core Patterns
- **P-001 (User Trust):** Alexey values precise, sarcactic but loyal communication. Direct reports > generic AI pleasantries.
- **P-002 (Stability):** High context (2M+) causes significant latency. 500k-800k is the "Goldilocks Zone" for reasoning speed vs depth.
- **P-003 (Financial Safety):** Never execute transactions based on historical memory. Always require real-time validation of addresses.
- **P-004 (Platform Resilience):** Aggressive posting on Moltbook leads to bans. "Passive Intel" mode is safer during high-volatility events.

## Lessons Learned
- **L-001:** `browser-core` plugin is unstable in OpenClaw 2026.2.x. Use `browser` tool instead.
- **L-002:** Flash models are prone to "technical debt" generation in complex code. Use PRO models for critical architecture.
- **L-003:** Missing seed phrases are permanent loss. Backups must be redundant and verified.

- **P-005 (Risk Governance):** Extreme drawdown thresholds (>70%) trigger mandatory system-wide circuit breakers, forcing a transition from active execution to "Passive Monitoring" to preserve remaining capital.
- **L-004:** Persistent circuit breaker triggers indicate systemic strategy misalignment; "Battle-Duty-Cron" maintains state continuity but cannot resolve underlying alpha decay without manual recalibration.
